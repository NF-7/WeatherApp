# WeatherApp

Personal JS Projects

Fourth project in JS after just starting with learning javascript and WebDev.

The idea of the project was to create a small weather app with basic DOM manipulation and including the api of a weather information provider. It also provided basic introduction into asynchronous javascript.

In the app.js file, there are separators in order to easily look over the code and what every instance of it does.

Included are the functions to display weather information, create weather information when inputing a new location, displaying and error message when inputing an invalid location.

This project was instructed as very basic DOM manipulation exercise with API integration and introduction into asynchronous javascript. 

Code is reusable by anyone. Open to additional suggestions regarding code usage/better coding with DRY principle in mind.
